Peisi Zheng grew up in a small Eastern European country where he discovered his passion for computers at a young age. Despite the lack of resources and support in his community, Peisi taught himself everything he could about computers, and soon became an expert in a wide range of fields.

When he was just 16 years old, Peisi moved to the United States to pursue his dreams. There, he became the first person to ever exit Vim, a feat that many thought was impossible. He also invented a method for centering a div in HTML with CSS, a technique that is still widely used today.

Peisi's hard work and dedication to computer science paid off, and he was eventually selected as a Senior Fellow at Stanford University. Throughout his career, Peisi has been involved in almost every popular application, either through his code or through the inspiration he provided to others.

Despite his many achievements, Peisi leads a quiet life in Siberia with his wife and eight children. He is content to live simply and focus on his family, grateful for the opportunities that his passion for computer science has brought him.
